                    <p class="blog-post-description-text">Disney’s Cinderella had generations of children believe that a
                        dream is “a wish your heart makes”. But in a world that doesn’t revolve around fairy godmothers
                        and glass slippers, the Merriam-Webster dictionary defines a dream as “a series of thoughts,
                        images, or emotions occurring during sleep.” The insane stories that our minds produce during
                        sleep are intertwined with both culture and everyday life; many works of art, such as
                        Christopher Nolan’s “Inception” and The Police’s “Every Breath You Take,” came to their creators
                        in dreams. “You won’t believe what I dreamt about last night” is an incredibly popular
                        conversation starter, too. But is there a connection between dreams and our mental health?
                        <br><br>
                        Dreaming occurs in the final phase reached while sleeping, the REM (rapid eye movement) sleep
                        phase. We enter the REM phase during the first 90 minutes of falling asleep; after that, the
                        phase occurs several times in a night. As one can probably conclude from its name, during the
                        REM sleep cycle the body acts a bit differently than during the rest of the night. The changes
                        include rapid eye movement as well as increased heart rate and brain activity.
                        <br><br>
                        Our REM sleep plays a crucial role in the connection between dreaming and anxiety. There are two
                        key factors that influence this: our levels of anxiety during the day and our ability to develop
                        and use coping skills. A study from Rutgers University states that “the more REM sleep the
                        subject had, the weaker the fear-related effect” was during the time when they were awake. The
                        researchers followed it up with the statement: “Our results suggest that baseline REM sleep may
                        act as a protectant against excessive activation in fear-related neural circuits.” The
                        relationship between REM sleep and coping mechanisms was studied by a group of researchers in
                        2004; their research concluded that REM sleep deprivation in animals caused abnormalities in
                        their coping responses. To put it in the simplest of terms: the more time we spend in the
                        “dreaming phase”, the less anxiety we’ll have the next day.
                        <br><br>
                        Now that we can trace the link between our dreams and mental health, only one question remains:
                        what can we do to increase the time we spend in the REM sleep stages? Unfortunately for all of
                        us who pull all-nighters often, the answer is brutally simple: we have to just… sleep more.
                        Sleeping more gives you more chances to complete the sleep cycle and enter REM; also, each REM
                        phase gets progressively longer the more you sleep. So try to spend a good amount of time in the
                        arms of Morpheus tonight. Good luck and sweet dreams!
