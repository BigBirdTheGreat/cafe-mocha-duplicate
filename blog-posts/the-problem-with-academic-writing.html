                <div class="blog-post-description">
                    <p class="blog-post-description-text">When it comes to academic writing, we generally follow an
                        instilled thought process, predetermined ideas of "this is the correct way because this is how
                        it's traditionally done."

                        Models of academic writing are frequently lifeless, linguistically bloated, and at worst,
                        indigestible. And, arguably, the insistence on Harvard Referencing obstructs any elegance and
                        flow in a text —— turning it into a turgid swamp of brackets, names, and dates.

                        Yet the message to students is: this is the academic genre done correctly, now go and do
                        likewise.
                        <br>
                        We must question ourselves: What effect do these existing ideas and practices have on students
                        who need to submit written assignments?
                        <br>
                        What if there were a break with tradition? What if written language were presented not as a
                        stale and immutable set of laws but as a musical instrument: one that students could shape and
                        refine and transform, to make it sing and sparkle, to paint it with personality?

                        If decolonizing the curriculum is about questioning top-down impositions and the requirement to
                        conform, unquestioningly, to a pre-set template, has the time come to challenge standard notions
                        of academic language? Could this enable us to encourage a genuine multiplicity of voices and a
                        true affirmation of unique identity, rather than joyless uniformity?
                        <br>
                        Historically, and still today, archives primarily reflect the experiences and activities of
                        those who hold, or have held, positions of power in society. This means that archives are
                        overwhelmed with the collections of a narrow demographic. It is important to acknowledge this so
                        that we don't just see archives as places that hold 'neutral facts' about certain subjects,
                        because the reality is that so many voices and stories about these subjects are absent from the
                        archive.
                        <br>
                        We also need to be careful about how we interpret the material that is held. The unconscious
                        bias of the archivist can affect what is kept and how it is managed, and the bias of the
                        researcher interpreting this material also affects how the information is used and presented.
                        The ultimate result is that 'original source material ' has already been subject to multiple
                        layers of bias. Whilst archives are a really valuable resource for teaching and studying, both
                        in academic and creative practice, the concept of archival bias is important to be aware of when
                        using an archive.
                        <br>
                        As academics, we must take responsibility and make a constant effort in addressing this legacy
                        of bias through reappraisal of our wider collection and management policies. Accountability must
                        also be fostered in archivists to 'fill in the gaps in representation within institutional
                        archives, to challenge the traditional uses of archives, and promote new ways of understanding
                        this material and reinterpretation through their own practice.
