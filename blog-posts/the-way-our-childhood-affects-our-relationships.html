                    <p class="blog-post-description-text">One's childhood has a great impact on their relationships.
                        People's early experiences shapetheir beliefs about the world. It decides whether the world is a
                        safe place for them or a dangerous and unsafe one. People with childhood trauma tend to have
                        more negative experiences with relationships. When the people we depended on for our survival
                        hurt us, either physically or mentally, or were absent, we tend to perceive relationships in a
                        similar way, believing everyone would hurt us the same way. On the other hand, when our
                        caregivers are emotionally and physically present for us in childhood, we have an entirely
                        positive outlook towards relationships. Also our childhood relationships greatly affect the
                        types of attachments we form and this is where the attachment theory comes into play. The theory
                        states the path our adult relationships mirror the bonds we had with our primary caregivers and
                        there are 4 types of attachments based on that:
                        <br><br>
                    <ol>
                        <li>SECURE ATTACHMENT CHARACTERISTICS</li>
                        Parents of such people tend to play more of a role in a children's upbringing and needs. They
                        are more responsive, also quick to respond to their child's needs. Such children find comfort in
                        the presence of their parents and become visibly upset when the parent is away but regains the
                        comfort when they are back. They tend to be closer to their parents. Such individuals, when
                        adults have more long lasting relationships, have more sense of self esteem. They share their
                        feelings with their partner and friends and tend to seek social support. Also, such children
                        tend to be less aggressive and more mature.
                        <br><br>
                        <li>AMBIVALENT ATTACHMENT CHARACTERISTICS</li>
                        These children show great distress when separated from the parent or caregiver but do not seem
                        to get comforted when they return. They are highly suspicious of strangers and feel
                        uncomfortable in the presence of one. In some cases the child might refuse the comfort offered
                        by the parent. Such children, when adults are reluctant to become close to others and worry that
                        their partner won't reciprocate the same feelings. This results in frequent breakups and the
                        individual seems to be distraught after the end of a relationship
                        <br><br>
                        <li>AVOIDANT ATTACHMENT CHARACTERISTICS</li>
                        Such children are grown with parents who are either emotionally or physically absent or
                        both.
                        Such children tend to avoid their parental comfort and contact. They often prefer strangers
                        over
                        their parents or caregiver. Such children, when adults try to avoid emotional intimacy in a
                        relationship and have little to no effect when the relationship ends. They try to avoid
                        getting into a relationship by giving various excuses.
                        <br><br>
                        <li>DISORGANIZED ATTACHMENT CHARACTERISTICS</li>
                        Parents of such children didn't provide a safe place for them to grow. The child loves them,
                        but
                        also fears them. In this case, the child is confused about how their caregiver will respond
                        to
                        their needs. They want to seek support, but are also scared of doing so. The child in later
                        stages may take a parental role and act like the caregiver of the parent. Most psychologists
                        believe that this is one of the most difficult of the three insecure attachment styles to
                        deal
                        with.
