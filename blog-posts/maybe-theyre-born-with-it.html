                <div class="blog-post-description">
                    <p class="blog-post-description-text">“Stop complaining about your food! Kids in Africa would kill
                        to have even a bite of this.” I believe myriads of us have been bore with lectures akin to this,
                        but how many of us have truly understood that being able to have a choice in what we consume is
                        a privilege?
                        <br><br>
                        Many will argue that these privileges are obligatory, that everyone should be granted access to
                        them, and that each individual should be treated as an equal. But this is not the perfect world
                        portrayed in fairy tales or films; this is the real, cruel world; this is a world where certain
                        groups are given social advantages solely because of their identity.
                        <br><br>
                        Whether intentional or not, if you choose to stay silent and stand idly by as the marginalized
                        fight for their rights, you are participating in the purposeful perpetuation of a system that
                        has and will continue to suppress one’s culture, while uplifting the values of another. However,
                        if you choose the latter, which is using your privilege to fight injustice and become an active
                        agent of change, you are on the right track.
                        <br><br>
                        One of the difficulties faced by the marginalized is that when they share their stories and the
                        issues they face, they are brushed off because of how absurd they may sound. The sole act of
                        confiding in you indicated their trust in you. So listen, and trust their experiences instead of
                        providing unsolicited advice.
                        <br><br>
                        Besides that, when you come across people whose voice is drowned out, spread word about their
                        capabilities, give credit to their work and point out prejudices.
                        Acknowledging your privilege is not disgraceful, being silent is. The world needs you to act
                        now. Every little effort counts, so don’t wait. You never know when another life will be
                        forsaken because of your silence.
