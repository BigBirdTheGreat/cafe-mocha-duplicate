                    <p class="blog-post-description-text">So, everyone. I’m new here. 

                        I joined the Cafe Mocha team a few weeks ago. I received a warm welcome,
                        a cute little message from my director, and, just yesterday, my first
                        writing assignment (hooray!). So I’m scouring the internet and my brain 
                        with rabid enthusiasm, trying to cough up a topic that would not only 
                        resonate with people but spur them into action as well. Two hours pass, 
                        and you know how many ideas I had?
                        
                        <br><br>

                        A fat, glorious zero.
                        
                        <br><br>

                        And I realized that, at that moment, I didn’t really know what I was doing. 
                        I knew I was passionate about mental health awareness - it’s an issue I’ve 
                        seen far too many struggles with in the past - and I knew I was a strong writer. 
                        But still, I felt fake. I thought to myself, “How can you work alongside these 
                        people? You’ve never written to the public like this before. Do you even deserve 
                        to be on this team?”.
                        
                        <br><br>

                        In small quantities, feelings like this are inevitable in one's life. But having 
                        this mindset of incompetency day after day, week after week, can have huge implications 
                        on one’s health. There’s even a name for it: impostor syndrome. According to the <a class= "blog-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16143384/">National 
                        Institutes of Health</a> (NIH), a person with imposter syndrome “struggles with accurately 
                        attributing their performance to their actual competence”. This phenomenon has become an 
                        increasingly common issue; according to a <a class= "blog-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16143384/">series of studies by the NIH</a>, the prevalence of 
                        imposter syndrome has reached as high as 80% in certain studies. And, though impostor syndrome 
                        is not a recognized psychiatric disorder, it has clear negative effects. A <a class= "blog-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16143384/">study by Tonia Caselman</a>
                        found that self-worth, confidence, sociability, and dependability are found on an inverse 
                        relationship with the severity of impostor syndrome. 
                        
                        <br><br>
                        
                        As with many struggles involving mental health, it’s hard to pin down an exact way to combat impostor syndrome.
                        An <a class= "blog-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/guides/working-womans-handbook/overcome-impostor-syndromerecommends">article by the New York Times</a> everything from self-affirmations to accomplishment lists to 
                        visualizations, while <a class= "blog-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16143384/">Caselman's study</a> simply recommends seeking professional help. But all the sources I’ve seen 
                        have agreed on one thing; the most important step to addressing impostor syndrome is realizing you have it. I hope 
                        that, by reading this article, you have taken a moment to consider whether you may be suffering from this or a similar 
                        issue.
