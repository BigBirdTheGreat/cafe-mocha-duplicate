                    <p class="blog-post-description-text">At my school, it is popular to put stickers in phone 
                        cases or on water bottles. Glossy, laminated stickers, with cute illustrations and tiny 
                        quotes. Recently, one sticker has become particularly popular. A phrase, next to a little 
                        gold crown with sparkles and colored stripes in the background, declaring to the entire 
                        world that “I’m an anxiety queen”. 
                        
                        <br><br>
                        An anxiety queen? Is that supposed to be a good thing?
                        
                        <br><br>
                        
                        I believe we all know the stigma that revolves around mental health, and how mental 
                        illness is often shunned or looked down upon in today's society. But there is another 
                        side, just as harmful, that we rarely discuss. The glorification of mental illness, though 
                        arguably less acknowledged, is a facet just as harmful to our understanding of mental health. 
                        Today, we are often faced with movements portraying mental health not as something we should 
                        strive to acknowledge and protect, but rather as a tool for publicity and fame. 
                        
                        <br><br>

                        For example, the death of Robin Williams by suicide in 2014 was often blown up with graphic 
                        information and titles, explaining in detail the method of suicide and objects used. According 
                        to the <a class= "blog-link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2018/02/07/robin-williamss-suicide-was-followed-by-a-sharp-rise-in-copycat-deaths/">CDC</a>, in the four months that followed, the rate of suicide by the same method increased 
                        by 32% while the overall rate of suicide increased by 10%. And in the month following the release 
                        of the Netflix series 13 Reasons Why (a show commonly criticized for sensationalizing mental 
                        illness), <a class= "blog-link" href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/news/science-news/2019/release-of-13-reasons-why-associated-with-increase-in-youth-suicide-rates">the National Institute of Mental Health</a> (NIMH) recorded almost a 30% increase in suicide 
                        rates by American youth.
                        
                        <br><br>
                        
                        Situations like these paint mental illness not as an issue, but as a form of entertainment. 
                        They imply that poor mental health is to be dramatized and popularized, and is something 
                        that people should want to see. According to <a class= "blog-link" href="https://www.nami.org/Blogs/NAMI-Blog/May-2019/From-Stigmatized-to-Sensationalized">National Alliance on Mental Illness</a> (NAMI), 
                        “sensationalism (of mental health issues) can lead people to believe that mental illness is 
                        just a part of who they are, and that therapy is a ‘sham’”. 
                        
                        <br><br>

                        The glorification of mental illness is a serious issue that negatively impacts the public’s 
                        interpretation of mental health. Though not as well known as the overarching mental health 
                        stigma, it is still harmful and should be acknowledged.
