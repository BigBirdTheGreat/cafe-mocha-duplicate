                    <p class="blog-post-description-text">We are human beings and as humans, we feel a need to belong.
                        We feel the need to be accepted. But what if this need goes beyond control? That's when
                        people-pleasing comes into play. Now, what exactly is pleasing people? It is a tendency to
                        please others often at the expense of one's own physical/mental/emotional needs.
                        <br><br>
                        There's nothing wrong with being polite, kind and helping others. The devil is in overdoing the
                        kindness, which is often referred to as the ‘Good girl' - Syndrome. There are a lot of reasons
                        for this behavior, mainly revolving around culture, genetic composition and upbringing of an
                        individual.
                        <br><br>
                        Culture plays a great role in developing one's tendency to please people. In many cultures
                        around the world, we see that women are more prone to be people-pleasers rather than men because
                        they are taught to be more self-sacrificing. They are taught that to be accepted by society they
                        have to give up on their own needs and wants. But it's not that men are not taught something
                        similar. They are taught that to meet the needs of others, they have to compromise their own
                        needs. The thing is that, even in 2021, women are more conditioned to the traits of people
                        pleasing than men are which makes them more prone to several emotional and mental illnesses as
                        they are compromising on their own needs to meet the needs of others.
                        <br><br>
                        Genetic factors also contribute a great deal. There are certain genes which regulate our
                        temperament and our reactions to different actions happening around us. For example a certain
                        category of people called the Highly Sensitive People (HSP) which make up about 20% of the human
                        population are more sensitive to the needs of others and how others see them, so they tend to be
                        greater people-pleasers than the rest of the population.
                        <br><br>
                        Another very important thing that plays a very very significant role is the upbringing of an
                        individual. The relationship with their parents, whether they felt constantly loved, or felt
                        loved only when they did something that pleased their parents determines a lot. This can be the
                        most important factor of all. So a good upbringing is really necessary for the overall well
                        being of an individual, because due to poor parenting skills, not only one person suffers, but
                        that negativity is passed on to generations, being considered normal.
                        <br><br>
                        Creating boundaries is really important for one to stop the habit of pleasing people. They need
                        to identify their own needs and keep them above everything else. Knowing that keeping yourself
                        as the priority isn't selfish, but is self-love. Understanding that you can't control what
                        others think or feel about you and you can't make everyone happy is a thing of utmost
                        importance. Defining your goals in life and focusing on what is important might help too. Most
                        of all, knowing your self-worth, and that you are the best version of yourself, despite what
                        others think is the key. All of this will take a lot of patience and strength, but once you
                        master the art of not pleasing people, you'll be the happiest version of you!
