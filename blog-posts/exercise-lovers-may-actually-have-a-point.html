                    <p class="blog-post-description-text">Even though I’m not exactly a couch potato, I wouldn’t call
                        myself an exercise junkie either - I bike quite a lot and I’m known to be a very fast walker on
                        even the most challenging terrains, but I never put much effort into staying fit. I do, however,
                        know a lot of people who exercise like it’s their last day on Earth, and link their exercise
                        routines to the reason why their lives are going well. I always considered those claims to be an
                        exaggeration and some sort of placebo effect rather than having an actual, scientific
                        explanation. Because sure, exercise helps your body stay fit, which can prevent a lot of health
                        problems, but it won’t make you smarter or calmer, right?
                        <br><br>
                        Right?
                        <br><br>
                        I hate being proven wrong, so I write this with hesitation, but: after doing some research, I
                        found out that regular exercise is one of the most powerful things that one can easily implement
                        into their life, that will keep it in check.
                        <br><br>
                        First of all, exercise can make you less anxious. According to a study done in 2018, exercise
                        programs are effective in the treatment of anxiety; more intense exercise was found to be more
                        effective than low intensity exercise.
                        <br><br>
                        As much as reducing anxiety levels is great already, the surprising outcomes of regular exercise
                        don’t end there. Rigorous exercise has been shown to increase levels of BDNF, or brain-derived
                        neurotrophic factor, which is a protein produced inside nerve cells that improves the work of
                        your brain. Low BDNF levels have been linked to Alzheimer’s disease, sclerosis, and anxiety, and
                        the higher your BDNF levels are, the easier it is for you to learn and memorize things.
                        Exercising is one of the ways in which you can increase your BDNF levels, and studies indicate
                        that it’s especially beneficial to memory.
                        <br><br>
                        Unfortunately, I have to accept my defeat and come to terms with the fact that my mom and PE
                        teachers weren’t encouraging me to exercise regularly just for the sake of it. Does anyone want
                        to become running buddies?
