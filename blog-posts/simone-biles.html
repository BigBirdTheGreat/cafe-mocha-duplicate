                <div class="blog-post-description">
                    <p class="blog-post-description-text">If you’ve paid any attention to what’s happening in the Tokyo
                        Olympics, you’ve probably at least stumbled upon the name of Simone Biles. The most decorated
                        American gymnast’s name is currently everywhere, from news articles, to Twitter, but this time
                        it isn’t caused by a spectacular win - it’s because of withdrawal. Last week, Biles announced
                        that she won’t be competing in the women’s team gymnastics final, which was later won by the
                        Russia Olympic Committee; the USA team scored 2nd place. During a news conference, the gymnast
                        said that she pulled out of the competition because she wanted to prioritize her mental health
                        and work on her mindfulness.
                        <br><br>
                        Biles’ statement resulted in not only a lot of kind words, but also quite a lot of backlash; the
                        words “quitter”, “weak” and “selfish” were seen thrown around. She momentarily became the butt
                        of jokes and the punching bag for anyone who wanted to diminish the importance of mental health
                        in people’s lives and careers. Unfortunately, it’s not the first time prioritizing yourself and
                        your mental health over your career has been ridiculed on the Internet. Hell, you cannot scroll
                        through Pinterest for 5 minutes without finding a cute, pink graphic about “quitter mindset”,
                        reminding you how you should power through your struggles and keep your eyes on the prize. I
                        really wish it were a joke, but “Stop crying… keep hustling” was one of the first results I got
                        after googling the phrase “motivational quotes”.
                        <br><br>
                        Even though most of us aren’t Olympic-level athletes, we’re still vulnerable to the dangers of
                        hustle culture. Defined by the Urban Dictionary as “the glorification of working very long hours
                        in hope of reaching one's professional goals while having a disregard for their health, and
                        relationships with loved ones”, it can have an impact on your wellbeing in both academic and
                        professional environments. If you’re a student, it might represent itself as the pressure to get
                        into a prestigious university or graduate at the top of your class; at work, it’s the urge to
                        move up the corporate ladder or start a successful side business while having a day job. While
                        there’s nothing wrong with the idea of success itself, hustle culture stems from the concept
                        that you are a worker or a student first and a person second. It tells you that you can only
                        validate yourself by how well you did on that math test or how fast you got promoted to regional
                        manager.
                        <br><br>
                        Thankfully, more and more people are realizing how toxic and dangerous hustle culture can be.
                        Raising awareness about mental health issues people face due to extremely competitive work and
                        academic environments and actively deglorifying “the hustle” are some of the most important
                        things we can do to improve our collective mental wellbeing. Our progress in this category can
                        be seen by looking at all the positive reactions to Biles’ withdrawal; the kind words and wishes
                        outnumber the insults and jokes. Hopefully, this situation will contribute to normalizing taking
                        mental health breaks and choosing your wellbeing above your professional success.
                        <br><br>
                        Hustle culture has no positive sides; it doesn’t make people more productive, it doesn’t
                        magically motivate lazier students. Instead, it demonizes taking care of yourself and links your
                        self-esteem to superficial values. That’s why you shouldn’t listen to the quote I mentioned
                        before; instead of holding in your tears and hustling no matter what, turn that “stop crying,
                        keep hustling” into “stop hustling, keep crying” and kick hustle culture in the face.
