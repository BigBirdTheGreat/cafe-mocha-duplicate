                    <p class="blog-post-description-text">The pandemic has brought many attacks and inconveniences for
                        everybody –including young adults – such as motivational slumps, burnout, and familial
                        disconnect.
                        <br><br>
                        According to UNICEF, one in two adolescents don’t feel motivated to commit to activities they
                        once enjoyed. When the pandemic started, stores, sports, and schools shut down, confining all to
                        their homes. For athletes, their sports might have brought them confidence and bonds, but with
                        everything shutting down, practicing with the team was a challenge. When these sports reopened
                        again, many athletes that didn’t practice during the lockdown fell behind and lost their
                        motivation to continue their sport. Additionally, because a large chunk of activities, like
                        volunteering and club meets, took place at school, the lockdown forced many to quit and lose out
                        on their time spent together.
                        <br><br>
                        Another problem with the shutdown was the intense burnout brought upon students. Taking
                        advantage of the online school year, teens started working harder to ensure their grades.. Even
                        if they wore comfortable clothes and were surrounded by a familiar environment, countless teens
                        became uncomfortable because of how strenuous it was to work for several hours on end. For me,
                        school lasted six hours straight on a computer. I never even took breaks because during the
                        passing period, I would frantically be searching for the next class’ Zoom link. Then, at lunch,
                        I would watchNetflix to entertain myself. My eyes never got a break, and I was tired nearly
                        everyday of online school.
                        <br><br>
                        For most, a neutral surrounding to have during the lockdown was family. According to Kids’ Minds
                        Matter, families have reported by getting their bonds to grow closer and stronger who were able
                        to cooperate with the tens and their lives. However, certain families grew apart: young adults
                        with abusive parents stressed out and itched to get out of the house.
                        <br><br>
                        A challenge for adolescents now would be getting back on track and trying to find themselves
                        after getting out of lockdown (depending on the state). After a harsh year of being stuck in the
                        house and losing ourselves, it is time to wait,recover, and hope for the best.
