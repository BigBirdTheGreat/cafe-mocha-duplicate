                        <br>
                        I’ve never seen an ugly actress in a teen movie.
                        <br><br>
                        I don’t mean “ugly” in the same way Anne Hathaway is considered ugly at the beginning of
                        “Princess Diaries” - I think we are all intelligent enough to realize that glasses and frizzy
                        hair never made those gorgeous actresses unattractive (hell, I sometimes found myself thinking
                        that main characters of teen movies looked better before their big makeovers). By “ugly” I also
                        don’t mean plus-sized because even though being overweight was a subject of ridicule for a very
                        long time in coming-of-age movies and TV shows, we are finally seeing more and more plus-sized
                        protagonists, who are just as beautiful as the thin ones. Here, by “ugly” I mean just… not very
                        good-looking on camera. Why do none of the teen movie protagonists have strangely-shaped noses
                        or bug eyes? Why don’t their mouths ever look weird when they’re speaking?
                        <br><br>
                        We have a problem with ugliness. Even with the body positivity and body neutrality movements, we
                        still tend to view people through the lens of how much they fit to our current beauty standards.
                        Very attractive people are often considered to also be funnier, more intelligent and overall
                        interesting compared to the ones that aren’t as conventionally pretty. This better treatment of
                        conventionally attractive people is often referred to as “pretty privilege” or “the beauty bias”
                        and it gets especially visible when we take a look at the most popular influencers. People like
                        Addison Rae, the Kardashian-Jenner clan and the D’Amelio sisters are all very conventionally
                        beautiful; you can easily gain a following on Instagram or TikTok just by being pretty, but
                        similarly to movie stars, I cannot think of an influencer similar to the ones previously
                        mentioned in the amount of followers that isn’t conventionally attractive. Moreover, many
                        teenagers and pre-teens look up to their favorite social media stars, they wish to have their
                        seemingly perfect lives, as well as their amazing looks. I’m not one to follow many influencers,
                        but I’ve definitely fallen into the trap of yearning to look like beautiful girls I’ve seen on
                        Instagram - and that’s coming from the perspective of a white, cis, able-bodied, relatively thin
                        person; I cannot imagine how pretty privilege affects young people who are trans, disabled, POC,
                        etc., which often have traits that don’t fall into the beauty standard that often.
                        <br><br>
                        Eliminating pretty privilege is a big task that I’m neither smart nor motivated enough to try
                        tackling. But if there’s one piece of advice to thousands of casting directors who could be
                        potentially reading this: think about making your protagonist have a crooked nose every once in
                        a while. Or cast a trans person or a person with a visible disability, even if the movie isn’t
                        about the character being trans or disabled. I can assure you your movie is going to do just
                        fine, and you might make a teen or two feel better with the way they look.
