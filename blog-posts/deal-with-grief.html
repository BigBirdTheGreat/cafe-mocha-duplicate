                        To whomever it may concern, I hope you are having a nice day. The words of Canon Henry Scott Holland just came my way, 

                        <br></br>

                        “Death is nothing at all. </br>
                        It does not count. </br>
                        I have only slipped away into the next room. </br>
                        Nothing has happened.
                        <br></br>
                        Everything remains exactly as it was. </br>
                        I am I, and you are you, </br>
                        and the old life that we lived so fondly together is untouched, unchanged. </br>
                        Whatever we were to each other, that we are still.”
                        <br></br>
                        Has it really been the same?
                        <br></br>
                        The story of Prince Siddhartha travels toward being a monk who preaches sermons. 
                        While hunting, he chanced upon a sick man, an aged man, a funeral procession, 
                        and a monk begging for alms. These sights moved him; he went out into the world 
                        to seek enlightenment concerning the sorrows he had witnessed. The enlightened 
                        prince who came to be known as Gautama Budhha is a lot more than mere awakening.
                        <br></br>
                        His words still ring true, if followed, 
                        <br></br>
                        “The world is afflicted with death and decay; the life of mortals is troubled, brief,
                         and combined with pain. As ripe fruits are early in danger of falling, so mortals 
                         when born are always in danger of death. As all earthen vessels made by the potter 
                         end in being broken, so is the life of mortals. Of those who, overcome by death, 
                         depart from life, a father cannot save his son, nor kinsmen their relations. While 
                         relatives are looking on and lamenting deeply, one by one mortals are carried off, 
                         like an ox that is led to the slaughter. Not from weeping nor from grieving will 
                         anyone obtain peace of mind; on the contrary, his pain will be greater and his 
                         body will suffer; the dead are not saved by his lamentation. He who seeks peace 
                         should draw out the arrow of lamentation, and complaint, and grief. He who has 
                         drawn out the arrow and has become composed will obtain peace of mind; he who has
                         overcome all sorrow will become free from sorrow, and be blessed.” [Source: 
                         Betty Renshaw Values and Voices: A College Reader (1975)]
                         <br></br>
                        There is no set form of grief and no right way to express it. For not everyone can enlighten the same as the Budhha, there is an expectation that after a loss, we discover, and progress systematically through the various stages of grief. Although this loss is personal and unique, a broad range of feelings and behaviors are commonly experienced. These include sadness (not necessarily manifested by crying), anger (confusing feelings of a survivor), guilt (“I might have not been kind to them.”), loneliness, and disbelief (usually, when it is sudden death).
                        <br></br>
                        “Say not in grief that she is no more,</br>
                        Say in thankfulness that she was,</br>
                        A death is not the extinguishing of a light,</br>
                        But the putting out of the</br>
                        Lamp because the dawn has come.”
                        <br></br>
                        This is a phrase by Rabindranath Tagore. It teaches us to be strong and support others 
                        in grief. Reach out and listen to their sentiments. Had they not been able to accept help, 
                        you must know that they want to talk about their thoughts and reminisce. Let them know 
                        that they aren’t alone. May Buddha’s words not hold meaning for a few, never fear that 
                        a happy moment won’t last more than a moment. You have the power to create incredible 
                        happiness and spread eternal joy.
                        <br></br>
                        Closing my statement on a positive note, your joy is your grief unmasked. The deeper 
                        sorrow carves into your being, the more joy you contain. Stay happy, stay blessed!
